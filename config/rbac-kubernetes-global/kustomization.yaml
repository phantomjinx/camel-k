# Converts all roles and rolebindings in rbac-kubernetes with a 'can-promote'
# annotation to ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings

# Note.
# The ClusterRoleBindings will be given the default 'placeholder' as
# the namespace of the camel-k-operator service account.
# Use `kustomize edit set namespace <namespace> to set the correct namespace
